# 1st contact with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 👨‍💻

These are my first steps and codes with:

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

- [javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

There are codes to learn the basics of those 3 above.

And, finally,  my first attempt to make a webpage prototype.
